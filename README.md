##service.flextabledit.jquery - Flexible Table Editor

###Description

**service.flextabledit.jquery** is a jQuery plugin that allows users to create, edit and manage grid cells that are arranged in table columns and rows. It is particularly usefull in enviroments where the user must be given the possibility to completely define both the structure and the content of a table; e.g. on a form of a web page.  
The purpose of the plugin is therefore not so much a table viewer but a real editor for grid-based data cells. The datasource for the plugin is therefore not a html table element but a javascript array holding the cell data.
